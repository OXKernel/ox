# get_data:
#
# Used to text the bootable image generated
# by the top-level makefile.
#
# We can diff the extracted binaries 
# with the ones used in the build.
#
# In general, get_data can be used to extract
# sections from a binary file. Combined with
# readelf -e vmox, can be used to extract
# various sections from the ELF file for
# comparison.
#
# Usage:
#
# ./get_data image_file offset size output_file
#
# NOTE: That addresses are in hex (so as to coincide
# with output from readelf -e).
#
./get_data vmox.img 0x0 0x200 s1
./get_data vmox.img 0x200 0x4000 s2
./get_data vmox.img 0x4200 0x2746d vmox.1

#
# check_null:
#
# Checks if a given byte in data is null and
# outputs its location if it is. Otherwise,
# outputs the byte and its location. Used
# to test if a specific section is null in a binary
# file.
#
# Usage:
# ./check_null file_name
#
