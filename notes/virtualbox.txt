If you don't want to test with Bochs,
you can use VirtualBox.  Personally, I think
VirtualBox is more accurate.

First, install VirtualBox on Linux (or your target
platform) from here :=

https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads

You should select the proper install image for
your Linux distribution and hardware. In my case, this is Fedora 16 "Verne"
(see /etc/issue for a description of which Linux you are running).
And its running on a 64 bit box so I needed to get the AMD64
version.

You need to first install the linux kernel development sources
(for example, package kernel-devel*.fc16 for Fedora 16)
as you need to compile VirtualBox kernel module before running.
Do this first, and then as root, run :=

rpm -i VirtualBox*.rpm

Once VirtualBox is installed, you should add your user to the vboxusers
group to allow VirtualBox to use USB devices. Although, OX kernel
currently does not have USB support. To do this, run :=

usermod -G vboxuser username

NOTE: If you install the VirtualBox rpm before the kernel development
package, you will need to install the kernel development package
after words, and run :=

/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup

as root before actually using VirtualBox.

Create a Virtual Machine for OX kernel, my configuration
is set to Other OS/Unknown with 256 meg ram and 256 meg disk.

Once this is done, see here how to boot
from floppy using VirtualBox :=

http://www.ehow.com/how_8456703_do-floppy-disc-image-virtualbox.html;

This allows VirtualBox to boot from a floppy disk boot image.

From the ehow website :=

~~~~
a) Select a virtual machine by clicking its name in the VirtualBox window.
b) Click the "machine" menu at the top of the VirtualBox window,
   and click "settings".
c) Click the "Storage" category in the settings window.
d) Right click in the storage tree pane (or select the
   right most plus button on the pane) and click
   "Add Floppy Controller".
e) Right click the Floppy Controller device and click
   "Add Floppy Device"
f) Click "Choose Disk" button in the prompt window that appears.
g) Navigate to the floppy disk image file on your computer
   and double click it.
~~~~

This should allow you to boot the image. In this case,
you should have it point to vmox.img file which is the artifact
created after the top-leve make file succeeds. vmox.img is a
1.44 Meg floppy image generated after compiling the boot loader
and kernel into an executable image. If all goes well, VirtualBox
should boot the kernel.

To update Virtual Box :=

rpm -ivh --replacefiles VirtualBox-4.2-4.2.12_84980_fedora16-1.x86_64.rpm
